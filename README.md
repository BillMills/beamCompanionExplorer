## Beam Companion Explorer 
A web app for exploring and visualizing beam companions picked up during charge state boosting in radioactive ion beam experiments.

## Description

The Charge-State Booster (CSB) is intended to produce radioactive ion beams in charge states greater than 1+. Stable isotopes are also ionized and produced by this device so must be considered when selecting which beam to extract. This tool may help identify which charge-state might be the cleanest when designing experimental proposals.

This project will extend and modernize [the original CSB Assistant](http://trshare.triumf.ca/~garns/CSB/) by [**@AdamGarnsworthy**](https://github.com/AdamGarnsworthy). Goals include but are not limited to:

 - port to JavaScript (+other server side stack?)
 - make use of url encoding for linkable, shareable results
 - generate reports useful for experimental proposals in a webby format: linkable, remixable and citable.

## Contributing

We're currently in a spool-up phase, and would like to hear from you! The best thing to do right now is to **check out the [planning milestone](https://github.com/BillMills/chargeStateBooster/milestones/Planning%20Discussions), and comment on any of the issues** you find there. If you have other ideas that don't fit into one of those threads, please feel free to open a new one on anything you like!
